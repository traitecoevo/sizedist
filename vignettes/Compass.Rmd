## Hi Daniel! 

This vignette is for orientating you to the package as you add more models to the package! I'm sure you know most if not all of this! 

```{r setup}
library(sizedist)
```

### .Stan files 

Place all `.stan` files under inst/stan.
Charlie has added several hierarchical models in the folder already! 

Now you have to compile the models so they are ready to go!
```{r}
pkgbuild::compile_dll() # Should do the trick!
```

If the above fails or you can seem to load your new models, go to the `Build` tab and click `Clean and Rebuild` or CMD-Shift-B just rebuilds but won't do the cleaning beforehand!

### Model-specific functions

```{r}

```

### Tips and tricks

```{r}

```
