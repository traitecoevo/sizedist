`sizedist` allow users to estimate growth and mortality in populations
as continuous functions using the theory of size-structured populations.
Read more about how `sizedist` is implemented in: Hinchliffe, C., Pepin,
P., Suthers, I. M., & Falster, D. S. (2021). [A novel approach for
estimating growth and mortality of fish
larvae](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/advance-article/doi/10.1093/icesjms/fsab161/6364353?login=true)
