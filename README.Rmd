`sizedist` allow users to estimate growth and mortality in populations as continuous functions using the theory of size-structured populations. Read more about how `sizedist` is implemented in: 
Hinchliffe, C., Pepin, P., Suthers, I. M., & Falster, D. S. (2021). [A novel approach for estimating growth and mortality of fish larvae](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/advance-article/doi/10.1093/icesjms/fsab161/6364353?login=true) *ICES Journal of Marine Science*.

## Installation
